# Loan-Approval-Prediction
Building a predictive model to predict if an applicant can repay the lending company or not. This project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (to see how the features of the dataset are distributed, also performed bivariate and multivariate analysis to understand how one feature impacts another), removing missing values, feature engineering (created new features: Total Income, EMI, Balance Income), building models like Logistic regression, Logistic regression using stratified k-folds cross-validation, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Grid Search, XGBoost. Amongst all the models generated the highest accuaracy was of model "Logistic regression using stratified k-folds cross-validation" which was 73.46%.
